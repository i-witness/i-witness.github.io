### Mission statement
---------------------
For years, govenmental and corporate interests have dominated the surveilance arms race.  

CCTV and ANPR are ubiquitous, facial recognition creeps into public spaces, and everything we do online is tracked.  

Digital monopolies convert our private lives into advertising revenue.  

In a climate of rising inequality and injustice, we aim to develop systemic oversight where it's *really* needed.  

### What does this shortcut do?
