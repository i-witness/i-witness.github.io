# iWitness: who watches the watchmen?

## Mission statement

For decades govenmental and corporate interests have dominated the surveilance arms race.

The deployment of CCTV, ANPR (number plate recognition) and facial recognition technology in our public spaces is becoming rapidly inescapable.

Online, tech giants like Google and Facebook track each user across the web, developing a profile of preferences and behaviour for sale to advertisers and political propaghandists.

Ever since Snowden exposed the extent to which western governments spy on their own populations,  
we have never been more aware that we are always being watched.

In a world where the state keeps an eye on every citizen, this project aims to utilise mobile and web technology to develop a platform where the tools of mass surveilance are deployed to serve the public interest.

## Our solutions

### "Be my iWitness" shortcut for iOS

#### Features

- Launch using either touch or voice input to assist in any encounter with law enforcement,  
  such as a traffic stop, stop-and-search or border control.
- Automatically sends SOS messages with your location to pre-configured SMS & email contacts.
- Records video from the rear-facing camera to save locally and upload to iCloud.

##### Coming soon

- Quickly share recorded video via social media to connect with other users.

#### Installation instructions

1. From an iPhone with the Shortcuts app installed (requires at least iOS 12), open the iCloud download link for the latest release. This should open the shortcut in the gallery.
2. If you receive a popup like `"Be my iWitness" can't be opened ... because your Shortcuts security settings don't allow untrusted shortcuts`, just open `Settings` then `Shortcut` and set `Allow untrusted shortcuts` to `true`, before reopening the iCloud link.
3. Review the shortcut and click `Allow untrusted shortcut` when you are happy.
4. Configure the shortcut by selecting SMS & email contacts for SOS messaging.
5. Open the shortcut details and click `Add to home screen` to create an icon in the home screen with which the shortcut can be launched.
6. When you run the app for the first time it will request permissions, which must be approved so everything works.
7. To run the shortcut using Siri, simply say "Hey Siri" (or double tap the home button) followed by "Be my iWitness".
