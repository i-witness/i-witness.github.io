### Mission statement
---------------------
For years we have watched state and corporate interests dominate the common good in a one-sided arms race of surveilance technology.  
CCTV and ANPR are now ubiquitous, with facial recognition in public spaces on the rise, allowing law enforcement unlimited oversight of our personal lives.  
Monopolies like Google and Facebook track us across the internet and sell our digital selves to advertisers.  
In a climate of rising inequality and racial injustice, we aim to enable systemic surveilance where it really should be targeted:  
at law enforcement officers.
