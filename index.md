Become part of the solution to ethnic profiling and unfair policing.

### Mission statement
---------------------
For years, govenmental and corporate interests have dominated the surveilance arms race.  

CCTV and ANPR are ubiquitous, facial recognition creeps into public spaces, and everything we do online is tracked.  

Digital monopolies convert our private lives into advertising revenue.  

In a climate of rising inequality and injustice, we aim to develop systemic oversight where it's *really* needed.  

### What does this shortcut do?
-------------------------------

The [iWitness shortcut for iPhone and Apple Watch](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/3f4158352e7d46459b2230f677697267) (requires at least iOS 12) is designed  
to have your back in any interaction with officers of the law.  
Simply install the shortcut by opening the link from an appropriate device, and follow the setup instructions.  

#### v1.0 (to be released)
* Trigger the shortcut in an emergency situation using voice control (iPhone & Apple Watch) and via a home screen shortcut (iPhone).  
* Once triggered, send your location to a preset list of trusted contacts via email and SMS.  
* Record video of law enforcement officers and upload it to your iCloud, and share it with us on Twitter.
