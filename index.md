### Mission statement
---------------------
For years, govenmental and corporate interests have dominated the surveilance arms race.  

CCTV and ANPR are ubiquitous, facial recognition creeps into public spaces, and everything we do online is tracked.  

Digital monopolies convert our private lives into advertising revenue.  

In a climate of rising inequality and injustice, we aim to develop systemic oversight where it's *really* needed.  

### What does this shortcut do?
-------------------------------

The iWitness shortcut for iPhone and Apple Watch (requires at least iOS 12) is designed  
to have your back in an emergency.  

Simply install the shortcut by opening the link an Apple device, and follow the setup instructions.  

The shortcut can be trigged either through voice control, or opening a shortcut on the home screen.  

#### v1.0 (first release, not yet out)
* Trigger the shortcut in an emergency situation using voice control (iPhone & Apple Watch) and via a home screen shortcut (iPhone).  
* Once triggered, send your location to a preset list of trusted contacts via email and SMS.  
* Record video of law enforcement officers and upload it to your iCloud, and share it with us on Twitter.
